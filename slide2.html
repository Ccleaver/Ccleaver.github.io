<h1>The beauty has been stripped away slowly</h1>
<p>There's a conclusion to my illusion
I assure you this
There's no end to this confusion
if you let it wish you well
soul to sell
highest bidders, can't you tell what you're getting?
There is a light to all this darkness
I will tell you this
there's redemption in you asking them just why it is
Some answers are better left unspoken when you know you ain't getting any

Younger, younger, younger
Are you?
Younger, younger, younger
Are you?
You ain't getting any
Younger, younger, younger
Are you?
Younger, younger, younger
Are you?

Why we fight to get on loving I've been wondering
How your mind will leave you hanging your heart lingering
stay lost
then found by whoever stays around, forgetting
There is a way to be yourself, I assure you this
There's a way to catch your dreams without falling asleep
You might as well get it while you can, babe
'cause you know you ain't getting any

Younger, younger, younger
Are you?
Younger, younger, younger
Are you?
You ain't getting any
Younger, younger, younger
Are you?
Younger, younger, younger
Are you?

There is a light to all this darkness if only we
fight against them telling us how we should be
I refuse to have you break me
when you know you ain't getting any

Younger, younger, younger
Are you?
Younger, younger, younger
Are you?
You ain't getting any
Younger, younger, younger
Are you?
Younger, younger, younger
Are you?

Younger, younger, younger
Are you?
Younger, younger, younger
Are you?
You ain't getting any
Younger, younger, younger
Are you?
Younger, younger, younger
Are you?
