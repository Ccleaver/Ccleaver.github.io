This here is a Minecraft digital sculpture. I created this in a virtual world within a world. This project means a lot to me because camping and campfires represent peace and tranquility as well as family experience and physical well-being. Nature is a tangible object unlike the creations inside a virtual world. After the world is destroyed, what survives will remain buried and hidden through time like greek marble sculpture. As technology advances, there is no way to access old sources since times progress. For example who has a device that can play VHS tapes? Its rare. Real life is now becoming rare since everyone is turning to computers for learning, social, and economical reasons. It is sad and I do not like it or care for it.</p>
